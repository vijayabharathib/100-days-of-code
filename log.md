# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started styling components using SCSS

**Thoughts:** I had to go through customizing workflow to make sass work along with the project that I am working on. It was created using 'create-react-app', which doesn't support sass out of the box. CSS modules within the components broke some tests (as webpack didn't recognize css). ignore-styles came to rescue.

Cleaned up the travis.yml to work on it's own (without custom install and scripts sections).

### Day 2: Jan 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed styling the entire box using SCSS

**Thoughts:** Had to include few svgs as part of the styling process and a good learning trying to make svg work within react. Also configured workflow to accommodate modular scss. The box finally looks well and made it responsive to different viewports too. More than an hour today. Wanted to move on the ingredients coding, will have to wait until tomorrow.

### Day 3: Jan 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on ingredients part of the recipie box

**Thoughts:** found it hard follow TDD, but had to keep that impulse to write app at check as I can already see TDD giving me good feedback on the existing code base.

### Day 4: Jan 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on ingredients part of the recipie box

**Thoughts:** coding this app with react and redux is overwhelming at times when things get messy with nested level of info. Had to go back to one step/one label/one button at time to stay motivated. finished the functional part of adding ingredients to recipies.

### Day 5: Jan 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started designing ingredients with sass

**Thoughts:** messed up travis tests and automatic deployment to github pages as my commit didn't include the new style files. it was working locally as the file system had all necessary files. however, since the commit did not have few files, tests were failing only during travis CI build process. Apart from that, the styling comes out good and looks lively now.
