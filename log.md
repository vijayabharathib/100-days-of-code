# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started styling components using SCSS

**Thoughts:** I had to go through customizing workflow to make sass work along with the project that I am working on. It was created using 'create-react-app', which doesn't support sass out of the box. CSS modules within the components broke some tests (as webpack didn't recognize css). ignore-styles came to rescue.

Cleaned up the travis.yml to work on it's own (without custom install and scripts sections).

### Day 2: Jan 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed styling the entire box using SCSS

**Thoughts:** Had to include few svgs as part of the styling process and a good learning trying to make svg work within react. Also configured workflow to accommodate modular scss. The box finally looks well and made it responsive to different viewports too. More than an hour today. Wanted to move on the ingredients coding, will have to wait until tomorrow.
