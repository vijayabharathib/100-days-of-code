# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started styling components using SCSS

**Thoughts:** I had to go through customizing workflow to make sass work along with the project that I am working on. It was created using 'create-react-app', which doesn't support sass out of the box. CSS modules within the components broke some tests (as webpack didn't recognize css). ignore-styles came to rescue.

Cleaned up the travis.yml to work on it's own (without custom install and scripts sections).
